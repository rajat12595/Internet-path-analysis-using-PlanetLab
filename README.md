# Internet path analysis using PlanetLab

In this project, I selected 10 nodes on the PlanetLab account and collected
data regarding networking between 2 nodes over period of time. Here in the
below report we have done analysis on the values of Round Trip Time, Total
hops, network outrage, fluttering and packet loss. What output we get from
analyzing these parameters is been shown in the below report. One of the
important results analyzed is that RTT over internet when two nodes are
connected has a range of [10-1000] ms depending upon their geographical
location. Also this report summarizes how stability of Internet routing has
increased.
